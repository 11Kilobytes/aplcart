# APLcart ‚Äì <sub><sup>*A novel approach to finding your way in [APL](#apl)*</sup></sub>

**There is plenty of documentation on what parts of APL do. APLcart seeks to answer *How do I‚Ä¶* questions.**

## Usage

Access-keys are <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> (<kbd>‚àß control</kbd>+<kbd>‚å• option</kbd> on macOS)

- Click [here](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart/) and start typing (access-key <kbd>Q</kbd> to re-focus)

- Click [`√ó`](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart/) in the top right corner to start a new query (access-key <kbd>X</kbd>)

- Click [APLcart](abrudz/aplcart) in the top left corner to go to the source code (access-key <kbd>A</kbd>)

- Click [`üîÖÔ∏éÔ∏éÔ∏é`](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart?w) in the bottom right corner to toggle white theme (access-key <kbd>W</kbd>)

Access-key <kbd>Z</kbd> focuses on the results' listing for keyboard scrolling.

## URL API ("permalinks")

As the query is modified, the browser address bar is updated too. Simply copy the current address to share the current query.

### Manual construction

After [abrudz.github.io/aplcart](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart) you can add `?` and the following options, separated by `&` if you want both:

- [`w`](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart?w)‚ÄÉuse white theme
- [<code>q=<i>query</i></code>](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart?q=query)‚ÄÉprepopulate query field

For example for a white interface looking for "find", use [abrudz.github.io/aplcart?w&q=find](https://abrudz.github.io/aplcart?w&q=find)

- General syntax, like `name f‚ÜêY`
